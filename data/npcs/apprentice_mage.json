  "long_description": "Lyra is a young woman in her early twenties, dressed in simple gray apprentice robes adorned with silver trim. Her auburn hair is tied back in a practical ponytail, though a few strands have escaped to frame her face. She carries a well-worn spellbook under one arm and a wand made of ash wood in her other hand. Her green eyes sparkle with enthusiasm and curiosity about magic. Scorch marks on her sleeves and a few singed spots on her robes suggest she's still learning to control her spells. Despite this, she seems eager and determined to master the arcane arts.",
