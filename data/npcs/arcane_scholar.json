She occasionally mutters magical formulas under her breath and makes notes in a floating notebook that follows her around.",

    "greeting": "Oh! Hello there. Pardon my distraction - I'm cataloging the magical resonances of the plaza. Fascinating stuff! Are you here to study with one of the masters? Each shop specializes in a different tradition of magic, you know.",
    "info": "Let me see... North leads to Master Pyrus's Sanctum for sorcery, south to Malachar's Den for warlock pacts, east to Elder Thornbark's Grove for druid magic, and west to Sister Lumina's Chapel for divine spells. Quite the collection!",
    "farewell": "Happy studying! Remember, the path to magical mastery begins with a single spell!"
