  "long_description": "Elara is a middle-aged woman with sun-weathered hands and a warm smile that never seems to fade. Her auburn hair is tied back in a practical bun, and she wears a simple brown apron over her green dress. Her stall overflows with fresh fruits of every color - bright red apples, golden oranges, deep purple grapes, and exotic fruits from distant lands. The sweet aroma of ripe fruit surrounds her, and she greets every potential customer with genuine enthusiasm.",
