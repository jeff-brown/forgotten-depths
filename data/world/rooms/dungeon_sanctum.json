  "description": "The deepest chamber of the dungeon is a vast circular room with a domed ceiling that disappears into darkness above. A raised platform dominates the center, surrounded by a ring of carved pillars depicting scenes of battle and sacrifice. The air crackles with residual magical energy, and shadows seem to move of their own accord. This place was clearly the heart of some dark ritual or forbidden practice. The only exit is back to the north - this is the end of the dungeon.",
