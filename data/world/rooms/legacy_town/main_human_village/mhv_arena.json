  "description": "You now stand inside the gates of the village's most noteworthy and notorious point of interest, the arena. The charred and stained stone walls and scattered bits of bone, armor, and weaponry lying among the debris on the packed earthen floor. A huge brass gong hangs at the center of the arena suspended on a framework made of the bones of some of the less fortunate of the arena's combatants. To the south is a wide stone staircase leading down to the dungeon gate. The exit through the arena gates is to the west.",
