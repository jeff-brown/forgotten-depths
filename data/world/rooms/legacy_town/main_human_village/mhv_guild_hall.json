This building is also a center of learning where the ancient art of sorcery is taught to those with the intelligence and skill to wield it effectively. Sages, wizards, and masters-at-arms rush about on errands or to and from training sessions. Ornately carved marble archways exit to the north and south, and a wide stone staircase leads downward.",
