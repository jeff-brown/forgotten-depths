  "description": "This chamber was once a workspace for arcane experimentation. Shattered alembics and broken flasks cover workbenches along the walls. Stains of unknown liquids mar the stone floor in rainbow hues. Shelves hold dusty bottles filled with mysterious substances, some still glowing faintly with magical energy. Strange diagrams and formulas are scrawled across the walls in faded ink. A heavy door to the south radiates a palpable sense of danger.",
