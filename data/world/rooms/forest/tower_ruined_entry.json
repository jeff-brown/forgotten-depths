  "description": "You are standing in a ruined entry hall. The tightly fit stone tiles that make up the floor and walls here bear signs of weathering and extreme age. Passages blocked by impassible rockfalls where portions of the ceiling fell in lie to the east and west. The only accessible passageway leads to the north into darkness.",
