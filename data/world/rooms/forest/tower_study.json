  "description": "You are standing in a small study that has somehow survived whatever cataclysm destroyed the rest of this once majestic edifice. The room is furnished with fine oak furniture which appears to be well kept. Among these items you note a large writing desk, a locked chest, and a large canopy bed. In the west wall of this room is a large fireplace where a warm fire burns brightly. The only exit is through a white misty archway to the east.",
