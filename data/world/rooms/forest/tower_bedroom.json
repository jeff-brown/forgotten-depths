  "description": "You are standing in a large bedroom that has somehow survived whatever cataclysm destroyed the rest of this once majestic edifice. The room is furnished with fine furniture which appears to be well kept. The color which seems to dominate the room is pink. The room gives the impression that it belongs to a young woman brought up by a family that was very well off. Most of the furniture in the room is pink and frilly, especially the large canopy bed dominating the northern portion of the room. In the bed lies a beautiful princess appears totally oblivious to the state of her surroundings. The only exit is through a blue misty archway to the south.",
