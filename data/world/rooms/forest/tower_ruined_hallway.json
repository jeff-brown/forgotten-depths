  "description": "You are standing in a ruined hallway. The tightly fit stone tiles that make up the floor and walls here bear signs of weathering and extreme age. The northern portion of this hall is blocked by an impassible rockfall where a portion of the ceiling fell in. To the west is a white misty archway, and to the east stands a massive iron bound oak door. The passageway continues to the south.",
