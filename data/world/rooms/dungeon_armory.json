  "description": "This chamber once served as a weapons cache for the arena fighters. Rusted weapon racks line the walls, most now empty or holding badly corroded equipment. A few intact pieces remain scattered on the floor - perhaps overlooked by previous scavengers. The room is a dead end, with only the door to the east providing an exit.",
