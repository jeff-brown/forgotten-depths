  "description": "A serene temple dedicated to the healing arts. Soft golden light filters through stained glass windows, casting colorful patterns on the marble floor. The scent of healing herbs fills the air. A large altar stands at the far end, adorned with symbols of restoration and life. Wooden pews line the sides, and candles flicker peacefully throughout the sacred space.",
