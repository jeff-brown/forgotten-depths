  "description": "The cobblestone streets of Millhaven give way to a rocky mountain path here. To the west, you can see the familiar Market Square with its colorful stalls and friendly merchants. To the east, a steep trail winds upward into the mountains, disappearing between towering peaks shrouded in mist. A weathered wooden sign warns travelers of the dangers ahead: 'Mountain Pass - Beware of Wild Beasts'.",
