  "description": "This small but enchanting shop specializes in magical potions and elixirs. Shelves lining the walls hold countless glass bottles filled with liquids of every imaginable color - swirling blues, vibrant reds, shimmering golds, and mysterious purples. The air is thick with aromatic vapors and the scent of rare herbs. A skilled alchemist stands behind a wooden counter cluttered with mortar and pestles, bubbling alembics, and ingredients in labeled jars. The exit leads west back to the Arcane Square.",
