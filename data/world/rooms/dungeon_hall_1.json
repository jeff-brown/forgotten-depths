  "description": "A long corridor stretches north and south, its walls covered in ancient carvings depicting warriors in combat. The stone floor is cracked and uneven, with puddles of stagnant water collecting in the depressions. To the west, a reinforced door stands slightly ajar, revealing what appears to be an old armory. The passage continues south into deeper darkness.",
