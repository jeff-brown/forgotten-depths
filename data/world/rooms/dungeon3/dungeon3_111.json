  "description": "You stare in wonder and the vastness and sheer beauty of the cavern before you. You have heard of caverns such as this, where subteranian streams and thousands of years of time wear away rock and create scenery that can be seen no place else. You peer into the darkness between natural formations including stalagtites and stalagmites, some over twenty feet tall. Something about this chamber unnerves you, despite the apparently peaceful setting. From what you can see, the only exit is to the west.",
