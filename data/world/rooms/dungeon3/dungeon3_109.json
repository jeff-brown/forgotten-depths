  "description": "The ceiling of this enormous cavern is shrouded in darkness high above your head. A huge tapestry covers the northern wall from the floor to some forty feet above your head. The tapestry depicts a battle between some exceptionally large members of the race of stone giants and a great dragon with razor talons and teeth as large and sharp as sabres. The only exit lies through an archway to the northwest.",
