  "description": "The earthy scent of wood shavings and beeswax fills this well-organized workshop. Rows of carefully crafted bows line the walls, ranging from simple hunting bows to elegant longbows. Bundles of arrows with various fletching colors are neatly arranged in quivers. A workbench near the window holds tools for bow-making and arrow-fletching. Aelwyn, the master fletcher, inspects her work with a keen eye.",
