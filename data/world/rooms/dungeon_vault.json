  "description": "A reinforced chamber with walls of polished stone and a heavy vault door that stands open, its locking mechanism long since broken. This was clearly designed to protect something valuable. The floor is littered with broken chests and scattered coins, evidence that others have looted this place before. However, a glint of metal in the corner suggests not everything has been found. A narrow passage continues south.",
