  "description": "The worked stone gives way to natural rock as the dungeon intersects with a natural cave system. Stalactites hang from the ceiling like stone teeth, and the sound of dripping water echoes throughout the chamber. The cavern is surprisingly large, with multiple dark recesses disappearing into shadow. A cold draft flows from the south, suggesting deeper chambers beyond. Patches of glowing fungi provide eerie illumination.",
